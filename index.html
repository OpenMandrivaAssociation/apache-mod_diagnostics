<h1>mod_diagnostics</h1>
<p><strong>mod_diagnostics</strong> is a debugging and diagnostic
tool for application developers - particularly filter modules.
It can be inserted anywhere in the Apache filter chain, and logs
traffic (buckets and brigades) passing through.  It is a purely
passive watcher, and will never touch the traffic passing through.
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>Probably the best way to explain mod_diagnistics is by example.</p>
<h3>Strange delays in some browsers</h3>
<p>In an update to <strong>mod_xml</strong>, a new bug was introduced.
It was not immediately obvious, but in some browsers the request would
hang and then timeout.  The effect was only observed when using the
XSLT output filter with Xalan-C, and only happened with HTTP/1.1
browser, not with HTTP/1.0.  Furthermore, hitting "cancel" before
the timeout in an HTTP/1.1 browser would cause the page to display!</p>
<p>Inserting mod_diagnostics before and after the offending filter,
the bug was immediately obvious.  The module was simply failing to
pass an EOS bucket down the chain.  A trivial fix!</p>
<h3>Obscure bug in a third-party library</h3>
<p>A user of <strong>mod_proxy_html</strong> reported serious performance
problems when parsing an 8Mb HTML file.  He had profiled the problem,
and found the entire processing time was in the final call to
<tt>htmlParseChunk</tt> in libxml2.</p>
<p>I investigated this by inserting <strong>mod_diagnostics</strong>
before <em>and</em> after mod_proxy_html, and running it with the
largest HTML document I had available (the MySQL manual, about 2.6Mb).
I was able to confirm that nothing was passed down the chain until the
final call, so not only was it slow, but it had also broken Apache
pipelining.</p>
<p>To refine the diagnosis, I added a flush in each call to the
filter in mod_proxy_html.  Now mod_diagnostics showed a small amount
of data (under 1Kb) coming through in the first call to the filter,
but nothing else until the end.  Further investigation showed that
the data stopped coming when the first HTML comment was encountered
in the source.</p>
<p>At this point I ran it under gdb, looking for the comment handling.
I found that it was failing to find the end of the comment.  The problem
was resolved only in the last call to htmlParseChunk, which didn't go
through the buggy code.  I disabled the buggy code, and found it was
now working correctly, with approximately the same amount of input
and output data in each call to the mod_proxy_html filter - so
pipelining was now fixed.  My correspondent reported total processing
Time for his 8Mb file reduced from 30 minutes to 9 seconds
(on five-year-old hardware).</p>
<p>The bug was reported to the libxml team, who have now fixed it.</p>
